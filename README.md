# Sales-Analysis-Report-using-Power-BI
A Power BI Sales Analysis Report providing interactive dashboards to track key metrics such as total sales, product performance, regional sales, and customer segments. The report leverages DAX, slicers, and custom visuals to deliver actionable insights for improving sales strategies and forecasting future trends.
The Power BI (pxib) file was quite large and was crossing the limit of upload size of GitHub so I had to upload a pdf of that.
